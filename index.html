            <h1>Github of the Kizano</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to the github of the Kizano. I've done the best I can to provide everybody
                with a friendly library that is a pretty elaborate extension of the Zend Framework.
                On this page, you will encounter a set of documents that elaborate a bit further on
                what was going on in my mind when I wrote up these creations you'll find in my github.
                So, let's begin, shall we?
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a list of the repositories I have on the spot as of now. If documentation is
                not present, consider it under construction as this github is rather young ;)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/markizano/markizano">Kizano Library</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/markizano/CurrencyConversion">Currency Conversion</a></li>
            </ul>
